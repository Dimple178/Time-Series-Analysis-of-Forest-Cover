# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Forest-Cover
# Time Series Analysis of Forest Cover Using Satellite Imagery

This project analyzes and forecasts forest cover over time using satellite imagery and a combination of image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from visual data and model future forest density trends to support environmental sustainability.

## üìå Project Highlights

- **Ratio-based Thresholding** to segment forest areas from satellite imagery  
- **Forest Cover Estimation** by calculating pixel-based green cover percentage  
- **Time Series Forecasting** using:
  - **SVR (Support Vector Regression)**  
  - **QNET Neural Networks**  
  - **Deep Learning models**  
- **Visualization & Dashboarding** with **Power BI**  
- Additional computations and simulations using **MATLAB** and **Python**
